# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 28, 2018
##### Basic setup and prepping for the real work (2h)

**Today's Progress**:
- Got the repo setup

**Thoughts:** 3th day of vacation and I'm starting to get bored... Time for some experimental coding? I Have a spell weaving system that has been brewing in my head since January 20th 2017, time to stop procrastinating and finally make a prototype and even a game around it.

### Day 1: July 29, 2018
##### Easier than I thought (4h+)

**Today's Progress**:
- Implemented a custom inputmanager by quil18creates (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSxifRKQKAA). Improved it and made it save/load to file.
- Got the spell weaving system working, including slots to use completed weaves as a component in another weave
- Implemented a cool event system by FuzzyHobo https://github.com/FuzzyHobo/UnityCallbackAndEventTutorial

**Thoughts:** Getting the (basic) spell weaving system to work the way I had imangined it, went way easier than I had anticipated, mulling it over in your head for more than a year seems to have some benefits. Rubber ducking to my helpfull sister in law certainly helped aswell.

### Day 2: July 30, 2018
##### Dealing with missing features due to work habbits (2h)

**Today's Progress**: Added a manual register/resolve custom IoC container

**Thoughts**: I really missed the functions IoC and dependcy injection give you the last fjew times I tried to get something done in Unity, so today I applied some of the knowledge I gathered from working as a 'real' software developer for the last 2 years to my hobby of game development. Alot of work is left to be done, but the progress today is a good start.

### Day 3: July 31, 2018
##### Long live MvvM (3-4hours spread over the day)

**Today's Progress**:
- Installed UnityWeld (MvvM for unity)
- Custom IoC container is usable with UnityWeld
- Created a basic Weaver UI controlled by Gamestate/Weaver (WIP)
- Started work on making the UI Clickable (WIP)

**Thoughts**: Taking some time to find an MvvM framework for Unity was well worth it. Also geting more fluent in setting up Unity UI with Layout Groups and using the correct Anchor Points. This is the first project where it doesn't feel like a struggle.
