### Day 4: August 01, 2018
##### More UI work (30m)

**Today's Progress**:
- Got keybindings scroll rect to work

**Thoughts**: 
- Scrollrects basicaly move something with a given width and height around relative to another rect. I would have prefered the name PanRect, but thats probably just me. Since I have a list that has a dynamic height, I had to update the the height of the "scrollable" rect to match the number of items in the list.

**Link(s) to work**: Demo not yet available
