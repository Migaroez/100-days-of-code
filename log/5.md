##### How bout then pivot points (1h)

**Today's Progress**:
- Made some basic models in blender
- Figured out how to nest the models properly so they could be loaded trough code without messing up the rotation and such.

**Thoughts**: There must be a better way to reset pivotpoints in Unity without encapsulating the gameobject in another gameobject

**Link(s) to work**: Demo not yet available
