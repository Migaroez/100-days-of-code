### Day 2: July 30, 2018
##### Dealing with missing features due to work habbits (2h)

**Today's Progress**: Added a manual register/resolve custom IoC container

**Thoughts**: I really missed the functions IoC and dependcy injection give you the last fjew times I tried to get something done in Unity, so today I applied some of the knowledge I gathered from working as a 'real' software developer for the last 2 years to my hobby of game development. Alot of work is left to be done, but the progress today is a good start.

**Link(s) to work**: Demo not yet available
