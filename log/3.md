### Day 3: July 31, 2018
##### Long live MvvM (3-4hours spread over the day)

**Today's Progress**:
- Installed UnityWeld (MvvM for unity)
- Custom IoC container is usable with UnityWeld
- Created a basic Weaver UI controlled by Gamestate/Weaver (WIP)
- Started work on making the UI Clickable (WIP)

**Thoughts**: Taking some time to find an MvvM framework for Unity was well worth it. Also geting more fluent in setting up Unity UI with Layout Groups and using the correct Anchor Points. This is the first project where it doesn't feel like a struggle.

**Link(s) to work**: Demo not yet available
