### Day 1: July 29, 2018
##### Easier than I thought (4h+)

**Today's Progress**:
- Implemented a custom inputmanager by quil18creates (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSxifRKQKAA). Improved it and made it save/load to file.
- Got the spell weaving system working, including slots to use completed weaves as a component in another weave
- Implemented a cool event system by FuzzyHobo https://github.com/FuzzyHobo/UnityCallbackAndEventTutorial

**Thoughts:** Getting the (basic) spell weaving system to work the way I had imangined it, went way easier than I had anticipated, mulling it over in your head for more than a year seems to have some benefits. Rubber ducking to my helpfull sister in law certainly helped aswell.

**Link to work:** Demo not yet available
