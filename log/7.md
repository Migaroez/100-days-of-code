### Day 7: August 04, 2018
##### All the prefabs?

**Today's Progress**: All the basic weaves are now projectable on the screen, So a demo is starting to be feasable.

**Thoughts**: Doesnt feel like this one counts as I didnt write a line of code, just alot of testing and configuring unity gameobjects around the system i wrote the days before.

**Link(s) to work**: Demo not yet available
